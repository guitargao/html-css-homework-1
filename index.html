         <h3>
            Here's a time line of Joe Satriani's life:
        </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text3">
      <ul>
          <li>Joe Satriani was born in Westbury, New York of Italian descent.</li>
          <li>He was inspired to play guitar at age 14, after hearing of the death of Jimi Hendrix.
        </li>
          <li>In 1974, Satriani studied music with jazz guitarist Billy Bauer and with reclusive jazz 
              pianist Lennie Tristano.
        </li>
          <li>In 1987, Satriani's second album Surfing with the Alien produced radio hits and was the 
              first all-instrumental release to chart so highly in many years. 
        </li>
          <li>In 1992, Satriani released The Extremist, his most commercially successful album to date.
               Radio stations across the US picked up "Summer Song", which got a major boost when Sony 
               used it in a major commercial campaign for their Discman portable CD players.

        </li>
          <li>In 1996, Satriani founded the G3, a concert tour intended to feature a trio of guitarists. 
              The original lineup featured Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson. The G3 tour has continued 
              periodically since its inaugural version, with Satriani the only permanent member. 
        </li>
          <li>On August 7, 2007, Epic/Legacy Recordings re-released Surfing with the Alien to celebrate the 
              20th anniversary of its release. </li>
          <li>In August 2014, Satriani participated in the G4 Experience—a week-long guitar camp—with fellow 
              guitarists Paul Gilbert and Andy Timmons, and keyboardist Mike Keneally.
        </li>
          <li>In February 2015, the first dates were announced for the Shockwave World Tour, in support
               of Satriani's 15th studio album, slated for release in July.
        </li>
          <li>On September 16, 2017, Satriani teased his upcoming 16th studio album, What Happens Next, 
              through social media.</li>
          <li>Satriani is considered a highly technical guitarist,[48] and has been referred to as 
              a top guitar virtuoso.[49][50] Satriani has mastered many performance techniques on 
              electric guitar, including legato, two-handed tapping and arpeggio tapping, volume 
              swells, harmonics and extreme whammy bar effects. During fast passages, Satriani 
              favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) 
              that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques 
              such as rapid alternate picking and sweep picking.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p>Satriani was influenced by Jimi Hendrix, and by English rock guitarists such as Brian May,
             Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, and Jeff Beck.[5][51] Satriani was also influenced 
             by jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth.
